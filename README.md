# Air Quality Index 

I became aware of the AQI while living in China and wanted to make sure that I was not taking risks when going outside to run and exercise. Now that my daughter is three years old, it's imperative that I konw the air quality for her sake. 

I made this with the [Air Visual API](https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api) and submitted it for a Hackathon on [DevPost](https://devpost.com/) 

My main troubles were after uploading. 
  - CORS - I couldn't get this to work well without installing a CORS extension on my browser
